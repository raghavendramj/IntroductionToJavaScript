try 
catch
---------> very less used concept

1. Closure
2. Hoisting
3. Methods of Arrays -> splice, slice, and other methods
4. Method of Strings
5. Scope -> Local scope, global scope, function scope
6. this keyword
7. Object creation -> 
	3 ways -> 
		using factory function
		using constructor function
		using literals

	
	substring -> (start, end);
	substr ->      (start, how many chars to extract);
	
	slice()
		-> extracts part of a string and returns the extracted parts in a new string
	substr()
		-> extracts part of a string, 1st -> start 2nd -> specified number of chars
	substring()
		->extracts part of a string, start to end 
	
	
	PUSH -> Add an element at the end
	POP -> Remove an element at the end
		
	UNSHIFT -> Add an element from the beginning
	SHIFT -> Remove an element from the beginning
	
	Ways to create objects:
	using litreals
	using factory function
	using constructor function
		// 1. new operator -> create a empty object -> {} => that
		// 2. it will set 'this' to that object
		// 3. It returns the object from that function -> this happens automatically
	
	
	
	Questions:
		index swap can be done in substring  i.e (5,1) treated as (1,5) but not in slice ..may be 
		substring also does same, no difference then?
